Extensions:
Added a mute button such that if the player wishes, the player can mute the sounds that occur when the ball hits the paddle or bricks.
	- We used an image of a speaker symbol found online called Volume up interface symbol free icon.

	- We took the image and inverted the colors such that it would look white on a black background, and also made a second image 
	which does not contain the 3 curved lines signaling that the sound is on (we made the volumeoff symbol)
	- Whenever the mouse clicks directly onto the GImage that is this mute button, the GImage switches to its counterpart (either volumeon or volumenull)
	- When the click occurs, it also triggers the _sound attribute in breakout to negate itself (either True or False) and this determines whether or not 
	sounds will play.
	- This was implemented with the sound method in breakout.

Added a sound whenever the ball hits either the paddle or a brick.
	- We used the stock sounds but included an extra sound Subsynth-modfilter

		under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.

	- We implemented sounds to play whenever the ball hits the paddle or brick by running the 
	play sound method whenever a collision occurs and if the game is unmuted.

Added "better player controls" whereas depending on where the ball hits the paddle, the bounce of the ball differs.
	- We implemented it such that if the ball is coming from the left and hits the left 1/3 of the paddle, 
	the ball would bounce back to the left, and if the ball is coming from the right and hits the right 1/3
	of the paddle, the ball would bounce back to the right. If the ball hits the middle 1/3 of the paddle, it 
	will just continue its x-direction and bounce up. 
	- This was implemented with the hitPaddle method in gameplay.

Added a countdown timer during the 3 seconds during countdown
	- This timer counts down in seconds starting from '3' the to '2' then to '1'.
	- The GLabel text will change numbers every 60 screen updates until it reaches 60 screen updates after '1', 
	where it will disappear and the game will start.
	- This was implemented in the countdown method in breakout.

Added a score keeper which increases by one whenever a brick is hit.
	- The score will be accumulate as long as the player still has lives remaining, but will reset upon starting a new game.
	- This makes use of the updateScore method in gameplay where it increments _points by one for every brick broken.
	- updateScore also updates self._score, a GLabel, to show the new _points value.

Added a way such that when you reach STATE_COMPLETE, you can click to start a new game.
	- At both the "Game Over" and "Congratulations" STATE_COMPLETE screens, you can click the screen and it will start a new game.
	- This was implemented by checking for a click while the _state is STATE_COMPLETE, and if a click occurs, will bring you to 
	the STATE_INACTIVE screen, ready for you to start a new game.
